# Simulations of simple ODE models in biology

These Shiny apps were written with sole purpose of teaching modeling in Biology. 

The models present are:
1. Simple bistable system
2. Glycolysis model of Selkov (oscillations)
3. The Goodwin oscillator 
4. Gene driven by oscillatory transcription factor

### Installation

```r
install.packages(c("deSolve","tidyverse","magrittr","gridExtra"))
runApp('<Name of model .R file>')
# It is often convenient to the click on 'Open in Browser' button in the new window to view the app in your browser.
```
