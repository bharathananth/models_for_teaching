# Simulations of simple ODE models in biology

These Shiny apps were written with sole purpose of teaching modeling in Biology. 

The models present are:
1. The Goodwin oscillator
2. Glycolysis model of Selkov (oscillations)
3. Simple bistability model
4. Gene driven by oscillatory transcription factor
